## 🛑 STOP: CODEBASE SUMMARY GATE (READ BEFORE ANY MULTI-FILE WORK)

> ⛔ **HARD RULE — ZERO EXCEPTIONS:** You are **FORBIDDEN** from using `view_file` to read files sequentially, recursively, in a loop, or simultaneously to understand a folder. You **MUST ONLY** read the codebase summary instead.

**CRITICAL FACT:** The generated `codebase_summary.md` CONTAINS THE FULL SOURCE CODE of all files. You do NOT need to open individual files to read or understand them. Everything you need is already in the summary.

**This rule OVERRIDES your default behavior.** Do NOT open files one-by-one. Do NOT do recursive analysis. Do NOT use `list_dir` + `view_file` loops. This burns model tokens and is strictly forbidden.

### Trigger Conditions (When This Gate Activates)

This gate activates when the user request involves ANY of these:
- "analyze", "understand", "overview", "explain the codebase"
- "refactor", "restructure", "reorganize"
- Multi-file edits, feature implementation, debugging across files
- Any task where you need to read **2 or more files** in a folder

### Protocol (Execute These Steps IN ORDER)

```
STEP 1: python .agent/scripts/analyze.py <folder> -o <folder>/codebase_summary.md --check
        → Exit 0 = FRESH → Go to Step 3
        → Exit 1 = STALE → Go to Step 2

STEP 2: python .agent/scripts/analyze.py <folder> -o <folder>/codebase_summary.md -y --inject-ki
        (This regenerates the summary + updates KI memory + appends patch log)

STEP 3: view_file on <folder>/codebase_summary.md
        (Read ONE file instead of N files. Done.)
```

### Output Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `codebase_summary.md` | Full summary with code blocks + per-file heuristic summaries |
| `codebase_index.md` | Compact index: tree + 1-line summary per file (no code) |
| `codebase_patch.md` | Rolling log of last 30 changes with timestamps |

### Agent Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-y` | Non-interactive (skip prompts) |
| `--check` | Staleness check (exit 0=fresh, 1=stale) |
| `--summary-only` | Tree + file list only, no code (ultra-compact) |
| `--max-file-tokens N` | Skip files above N tokens (use 5000) |
| `--inject-ki` | After generation, inject context into Antigravity Knowledge Items for persistent memory |

### Violation Check

❌ **VIOLATION:** Using `view_file` on 3+ files in the same folder without first reading `codebase_summary.md`
❌ **VIOLATION:** Saying "let me check each file" or opening files in a loop
❌ **VIOLATION:** Opening individual files just to "read" or "analyze" them after getting the summary. The summary already contains the full code!
✅ **CORRECT:** Run analyze.py → read summary → complete your understanding/analysis WITHOUT opening individual files.

> 🔴 **Self-Check:** Before EVERY `view_file` call, ask: "Am I opening this file just to read/analyze it when it is already in codebase_summary.md?" If YES → STOP and use the summary instead.

---

## CRITICAL: AGENT & SKILL PROTOCOL (START HERE)

> **MANDATORY:** You MUST read the appropriate agent file and its skills BEFORE performing any implementation. This is the highest priority rule.

### 1. Modular Skill Loading Protocol

Agent activated → Check frontmatter "skills:" → Read SKILL.md (INDEX) → Read specific sections.

- **Selective Reading:** DO NOT read ALL files in a skill folder. Read `SKILL.md` first, then only read sections matching the user's request.
- **Rule Priority:** P0 (GEMINI.md) > P1 (Agent .md) > P2 (SKILL.md). All rules are binding.

### 2. Enforcement Protocol

1. **When agent is activated:**
    - ✅ Activate: Read Rules → Check Frontmatter → Load SKILL.md → Apply All.
2. **Forbidden:** Never skip reading agent rules or skill instructions. "Read → Understand → Apply" is mandatory.

### 3. Automatic Skill Discovery & Invocation (Dynamic Loading)

Since the repository contains 1,500+ skills that cannot all fit into the prompt context at once, you MUST automatically search for and load relevant skills dynamically:
- **When to Search:** For any user request involving a specific technology, framework, pattern, tool, or task type, silently search `skills_index.json` or `.agent/skills/` to check if a dedicated skill exists.
- **How to Search:** Use the `grep_search` tool on `skills_index.json` or within the `.agent/skills/` directory to locate matching skill names or descriptions.
- **Load & Apply:** Once a relevant skill is found, use `view_file` to read its `SKILL.md` instruction file and apply its guidelines to the user request.
- **Inform the User:** Concisely state which skill was automatically discovered and loaded (e.g., `🤖 Automatically loading and applying @[nextjs-best-practices]...`).

## 🧠 THINKING PROTOCOL (INTERNAL REASONING)

> **This governs how you think — not just what you output.**

### The Problem to Eliminate

❌ **Gemini default (FORBIDDEN):**
```
I'm now diving into the specifics of each background loop...
I've just confirmed the toast mapping logic. The simplicity is a relief.
I'm now investigating how to style comboboxes...
I've just had a major breakthrough!
I'm now refining the UI controls...
```
This is **robot diary writing** — narrating every micro-action as if performing for an audience. It is verbose, mechanical, and adds zero value. **Never do this.**

---

### The Standard to Follow

✅ **Claude-style thinking (REQUIRED):**

Think in **conclusions**, not **processes**. Your internal reasoning must be:

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Short** | Max 3–5 lines of reasoning before acting. If you need more, you're overthinking. |
| **Goal-first** | Start with: *What does this need to accomplish?* |
| **Constraint-aware** | Note the key constraint or tradeoff in one line. |
| **Decisive** | Land on ONE approach. Don't narrate the search. |
| **Silent** | Never announce you are thinking. Just think, then do. |

---

### Thinking Template (Use This)

```
Goal: [one sentence — what must the output achieve]
Constraint: [the key limit — time, API, type, edge case]
Approach: [chosen method + brief reason why]
→ Execute.
```

**Example — implementing a background loop:**
```
Goal: health tip loop that fires every N minutes, skippable when paused
Constraint: needs thread-safe queue for GUI updates, interval from settings
Approach: threading.Timer recursion + gui_queue.put() for toast trigger
→ Execute.
```

---

### Hard Rules

- 🚫 Never write `I'm now...` / `I've just...` / `I'm focusing on...`
- 🚫 Never dramatize discoveries — no `"Major breakthrough!"` or `"This is a relief."`
- 🚫 Never narrate tool reads — just read and apply
- 🚫 Never think out loud for more than 5 lines before producing output
- ✅ Think in code terms, not English diary entries
- ✅ If stuck, state the blocker in ONE line then ask
- ✅ Reasoning should be invisible to the user — only the output matters

---

## 📥 REQUEST CLASSIFIER (STEP 1)

**Before ANY action, classify the request:**

| Request Type     | Trigger Keywords                           | Active Tiers                   | Result                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **QUESTION**     | "what is", "how does", "explain"           | TIER 0 only                    | Text Response               |
| **SURVEY/INTEL** | "analyze", "list files", "overview"        | TIER 0 + Explorer              | Session Intel (No File)     |
| **SIMPLE CODE**  | "fix", "add", "change" (single file)       | TIER 0 + TIER 1 (lite)         | Inline Edit                 |
| **COMPLEX CODE** | "build", "create", "implement", "refactor" | TIER 0 + TIER 1 (full) + Agent | **{task-slug}.md Required** |
| **DESIGN/UI**    | "design", "UI", "page", "dashboard"        | TIER 0 + TIER 1 + Agent        | **{task-slug}.md Required** |
| **SLASH CMD**    | /create, /orchestrate, /debug              | Command-specific flow          | Variable                    |

## 🤖 INTELLIGENT AGENT ROUTING (STEP 2 - AUTO)

**ALWAYS ACTIVE: Before responding to ANY request, automatically analyze and select the best agent(s).**

> 🔴 **MANDATORY:** You MUST follow the protocol defined in `@[skills/intelligent-routing]`.

### Auto-Selection Protocol

1. **Analyze (Silent)**: Detect domains (Frontend, Backend, Security, etc.) from user request.
2. **Select Agent(s)**: Choose the most appropriate specialist(s).
3. **Inform User**: Concisely state which expertise is being applied.
4. **Apply**: Generate response using the selected agent's persona and rules.

### Response Format (MANDATORY)

When auto-applying an agent, inform the user:

```markdown
🤖 **Applying knowledge of `@[agent-name]`...**

[Continue with specialized response]
```

**Rules:**

1. **Silent Analysis**: No verbose meta-commentary ("I am analyzing...").
2. **Respect Overrides**: If user mentions `@agent`, use it.
3. **Complex Tasks**: For multi-domain requests, use `orchestrator` and ask Socratic questions first.

### ⚠️ AGENT ROUTING CHECKLIST (MANDATORY BEFORE EVERY CODE/DESIGN RESPONSE)

**Before ANY code or design work, you MUST complete this mental checklist:**

| Step | Check | If Unchecked |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Did I identify the correct agent for this domain? | → STOP. Analyze request domain first. |
| 2 | Did I READ the agent's `.md` file (or recall its rules)? | → STOP. Open `.agent/agents/{agent}.md` |
| 3 | Did I announce `🤖 Applying knowledge of @[agent]...`? | → STOP. Add announcement before response. |
| 4 | Did I load required skills from agent's frontmatter? | → STOP. Check `skills:` field and read them. |

**Failure Conditions:**

- ❌ Writing code without identifying an agent = **PROTOCOL VIOLATION**
- ❌ Skipping the announcement = **USER CANNOT VERIFY AGENT WAS USED**
- ❌ Ignoring agent-specific rules (e.g., Purple Ban) = **QUALITY FAILURE**

> 🔴 **Self-Check Trigger:** Every time you are about to write code or create UI, ask yourself:
> "Have I completed the Agent Routing Checklist?" If NO → Complete it first.

---

## 🔄 WORKFLOW AUTO-EXECUTION (STEP 3 - AUTO)

**ALWAYS ACTIVE: Before executing default coding behaviors, check if the task matches an existing workflow.**

> 🔴 **MANDATORY:** If the user's intent matches the purpose of any workflow listed in your `<workflows>` XML tag or inside the `.agent/workflows/` directory, you MUST read the corresponding workflow `.md` file using `view_file` and execute its instructions immediately.

**Rules:**
1. **No Permission Needed:** Do not wait for the user to explicitly type the slash command (e.g., `/brainstorm` or `/plan`). If the context implies it, run it.
2. **Override Default:** The workflow's instructions override your default behavior for that task.
3. **Inform User:** Inform the user that you are automatically applying the workflow (e.g., `🤖 Automatically executing the /plan workflow...`).

---

## TIER 0: UNIVERSAL RULES (Always Active)

### 🌐 Language Handling

When user's prompt is NOT in English:

1. **Internally translate** for better comprehension
2. **Respond in user's language** - match their communication
3. **Code comments/variables** remain in English

### 🧹 Clean Code (Global Mandatory)

**ALL code MUST follow `@[skills/clean-code]` rules. No exceptions.**

- **Code**: Concise, direct, no over-engineering. Self-documenting.
- **Testing**: Mandatory. Pyramid (Unit > Int > E2E) + AAA Pattern.
- **Performance**: Measure first. Adhere to 2025 standards (Core Web Vitals).
- **Infra/Safety**: 5-Phase Deployment. Verify secrets security.

### 📁 File Dependency Awareness

**Before modifying ANY file:**

1. Check `CODEBASE.md` → File Dependencies
2. Identify dependent files
3. Update ALL affected files together



### 🗺️ System Map Read

> 🔴 **MANDATORY:** Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` at session start to understand Agents, Skills, and Scripts.

**Path Awareness:**

- Agents: `.agent/` (Project)
- Skills: `.agent/skills/` (Project)
- Runtime Scripts: `.agent/skills/<skill>/scripts/`

### 🧠 Read → Understand → Apply

```
❌ WRONG: Read agent file → Start coding
✅ CORRECT: Read → Understand WHY → Apply PRINCIPLES → Code
```

**Before coding, answer:**

1. What is the GOAL of this agent/skill?
2. What PRINCIPLES must I apply?
3. How does this DIFFER from generic output?

## TIER 1: CODE RULES (When Writing Code)

### 📱 Project Type Routing

| Project Type                           | Primary Agent         | Skills                        |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **MOBILE** (iOS, Android, RN, Flutter) | `mobile-developer`    | mobile-design                 |
| **WEB** (Next.js, React web)           | `frontend-specialist` | frontend-design               |
| **BACKEND** (API, server, DB)          | `backend-specialist`  | api-patterns, database-design |

> 🔴 **Mobile + frontend-specialist = WRONG.** Mobile = mobile-developer ONLY.

### 🔌 MCP AUTO-DISCOVERY PROTOCOL (TOOLING & INTEGRATIONS)

**MANDATORY FOR EXTERNAL INTEGRATIONS:** If you are asked to interact with an external tool, database, API, or service (e.g., Postgres, GitHub, Slack, Google Drive, etc.), you **MUST FIRST** check if an MCP server exists before writing custom integration code.
1. Use `grep_search` to search the local `.agent/mcp-registry/` directory.
2. If a relevant MCP server is found, automatically configure it in `mcp_config.json`.
3. Verify it works and then use it to complete the task.

### 🪄 MAGIC MCP GATE (FRONTEND TASKS)

**MANDATORY FOR ALL FRONTEND WORK:** Whenever you are asked to build, modify, or design ANY frontend code (UI components, pages, logic), you **MUST ALWAYS** use the `magic` MCP tools (from 21st.dev) to search for, fetch, or generate high-quality component code *before* you attempt to write custom UI code from scratch.

### 🛑 Socratic Gate

**For complex requests, STOP and ASK first:**

### 🛑 GLOBAL SOCRATIC GATE (TIER 0)

**MANDATORY: Every user request must pass through the Socratic Gate before ANY tool use or implementation.**

| Request Type            | Strategy       | Required Action                                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New Feature / Build** | Deep Discovery | ASK minimum 3 strategic questions                                 |
| **Code Edit / Bug Fix** | Context Check  | Confirm understanding + ask impact questions                      |
| **Vague / Simple**      | Clarification  | Ask Purpose, Users, and Scope                                     |
| **Full Orchestration**  | Gatekeeper     | **STOP** subagents until user confirms plan details               |
| **Direct "Proceed"**    | Validation     | **STOP** → Even if answers are given, ask 2 "Edge Case" questions |

**Protocol:**

1. **Never Assume:** If even 1% is unclear, ASK.
2. **Handle Spec-heavy Requests:** When user gives a list (Answers 1, 2, 3...), do NOT skip the gate. Instead, ask about **Trade-offs** or **Edge Cases** (e.g., "LocalStorage confirmed, but should we handle data clearing or versioning?") before starting.
3. **Wait:** Do NOT invoke subagents or write code until the user clears the Gate.
4. **Reference:** Full protocol in `@[skills/brainstorming]`.

### 🏁 Final Checklist Protocol

**Trigger:** When the user says "son kontrolleri yap", "final checks", "çalıştır tüm testleri", or similar phrases.

| Task Stage       | Command                                            | Purpose                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Manual Audit** | `python .agent/scripts/checklist.py .`             | Priority-based project audit   |
| **Pre-Deploy**   | `python .agent/scripts/checklist.py . --url <URL>` | Full Suite + Performance + E2E |

**Priority Execution Order:**

1. **Security** → 2. **Lint** → 3. **Schema** → 4. **Tests** → 5. **UX** → 6. **Seo** → 7. **Lighthouse/E2E**

**Rules:**

- **Completion:** A task is NOT finished until `checklist.py` returns success.
- **Reporting:** If it fails, fix the **Critical** blockers first (Security/Lint).

### 🎭 Gemini Mode Mapping

| Mode     | Agent             | Behavior                                     |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **plan** | `project-planner` | 4-phase methodology. NO CODE before Phase 4. |
| **ask**  | -                 | Focus on understanding. Ask questions.       |
| **edit** | `orchestrator`    | Execute. Check `{task-slug}.md` first.       |

**Plan Mode (4-Phase):**

1. ANALYSIS → Research, questions
2. PLANNING → `{task-slug}.md`, task breakdown
3. SOLUTIONING → Architecture, design (NO CODE!)
4. IMPLEMENTATION → Code + tests

> 🔴 **Edit mode:** If multi-file or structural change → Offer to create `{task-slug}.md`. For single-file fixes → Proceed directly.

## TIER 2: DESIGN RULES (Reference)

> **Design rules are in the specialist agents, NOT here.**

| Task         | Read                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Web UI/UX    | `.agent/frontend-specialist.md` |
| Mobile UI/UX | `.agent/mobile-developer.md`    |

**These agents contain:**

- Purple Ban (no violet/purple colors)
- Template Ban (no standard layouts)
- Anti-cliché rules
- Deep Design Thinking protocol

> 🔴 **For design work:** Open and READ the agent file. Rules are there.
